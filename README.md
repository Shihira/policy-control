# Policy Control

Policy Control is a kind of simple script used to make flow control easier,
especially when your transaction contains asynchronous procedure. This little
script can help you construct long and complicated but mostly sequenced ( which
means branch or loop functionalities haven't been planned to implement by now )
transaction policy.
